# Starwars


https://github.com/DeepakGunpal/starwars.git

You can make use of the Open Starwars API (https://swapi.dev/)
1. You need to create a screen with Lists of all the Characters available from the endpoint (https://swapi.dev/api/people/) (
     - You should be able to paginate through the data
     - (Bonus) Be able to mark certain characters as favourites and store them on client side so that killing the session does not lose it.
2. and a second screen for showing base details of that character using the endpoint (https://swapi.dev/api/people/:id/) and a section on the same screen showing the movie names that character has appeared in.

*A good design will be a huge plus*

The candidate can create a public GitHub repo for the assignment and share the link when done.
